# Slater Lab Administration

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts (sensitive scripts omitted) that I use to help monitor and manage the Slater Lab compute environment.

## Backup
 
Scan recursively `TARGET_DIR` and all of its sub-directories except those specified in the `OMIT_DIRS` array. Any file with a .sh, .py, .slurm, or .R extension is copied and stored in a compressed tarball located in `DEPOSIT_DIR`.
